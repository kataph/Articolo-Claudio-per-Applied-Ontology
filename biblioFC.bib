abstract={This chapter presents a methodological framework for ontology engineering (called DOGMA), which is aimed to guide ontology builders towards building ontologies that are both highly reusable and usable, easier to build and to maintain. We survey the main foundational challenges in ontology engineering and analyse to what extent one can build an ontology independently of application requirements at hand. We discuss ontology reusability verses ontology usability and present the DOGMA approach, its philosophy and formalization, which prescribe that an ontology be built as separate domain axiomatization and application axiomatizations. While a domain axiomatization focuses on the characterization of the intended meaning (i.e. intended models) of a vocabulary at the domain level, application axiomatizations focus on the usability of this vocabulary according to certain application/usability perspectives and specify the legal models (a subset of the intended models) of the application(s)' interest. We show how specification languages (such as ORM, UML, EER, and OWL) can be effectively (re)used in ontology engineering.},
